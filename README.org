#+TITLE: My personal emacs config

* WARNING

This readme is not up to date with the latest changes I have made to my config,
don't expect any of the key bindings described here to work in the current
version.

* Repo organisation

The configuration is currently organised in files under the =lisp= directory.

It is organised in =use-package= declarations.

The theme is the amazing =modus-operandi= by [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou aka Prot]].

* Using this config

Please use with care, this repo might change a lot and is tailored for my use,
which is probably not suitable for everyone. The configuration is used every day
at work with *GNU Emacs version 30.1*.

* Some notable key bindings (OUTDATED: To be updated/reused)
